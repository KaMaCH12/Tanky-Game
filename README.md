# OOP Course Project - Tanky Game
![TitleScreen](https://kamach12.github.io/images/Tankyss1.png)
This is a small game, I have created as a final project for OOP course at IT Institue of Wroc≈Çaw University in June 2020.
It's inspired by such legends as "Scorched Earth" and "Worms". Game is meant to be played by two players, taking turns one after another. 
Goal of the game is to destroy the other tank, while keeping player's tank intact.
The terrain is entirely destructible, and tanks can ride on it (although they won't climb vertical walls etc.).
Main font **isn't** mine. It's "Kremlin" made by Vic Freiger http://www.vicfieger.com/.
All textures were made by me.
All sound effects (+ annoying background music) were also made by me, while I was experimenting with my guitar's sound.
